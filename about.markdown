# About Me

Nekomangini is a passionate Flutter developer with a focus on building sleek, efficient mobile apps.
In my personal time, I am an animal lover with a deep affection for both cats and dogs.

### Notable Projects:

- **[Nekovim][nekovim]**: A customized Neovim setup optimized for productivity.
- **[Blenderkeys][blenderkeys]**: A set of keymaps for Blender aimed at improving workflow and user customization.

For more of my work or to get in touch, feel free to visit my **[GitHub profile]({{ site.github.owner_url }})**.
